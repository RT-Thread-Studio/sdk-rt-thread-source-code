> Notice:
> 
> 1. Don't use a same hardware timer to drive PWM (analogRead) and servos at same time, because hardware timers can only generate a same frequency for 4 PWM channels. Otherwise, it could cause a failure when drive servos.

## 3 Communication

### 3.1 I2C Bus

I2C bus is `SCL/D15` and `SDA/D14` pins. Users can directly include the `#include <Wire.h>`, which is the Arduino official I2C header file, to use the I2C bus.

### 3.2 SPI Bus

The SPI bus of the Nucleo board is the `CS/D10`, `MOSI/D11`, `MISO/D12` and `SCK/D13` pins printed on the board. These `D11`, `D12` and `D13` pins It is taken over by the RT-Thread SPI device framework and there is no need to directly control these pins. User needs to operate `D10` chip select pin. Directly quote `#include <SPI.h>` (Arduino official SPI header file) to use. After using the SPI function, the PWM function of `D10` and `D11` will be irreversibly disabled and converted to the SPI function.

### 3.3 Serial

This board supports to use `Serial.` method to operate `uart3` device. See [example](https://github.com/RTduino/RTduino/blob/master/examples/Basic/helloworld.cpp).
